# website
the code I did for my website (jeevitat.com)
NOT EVERY EFFECT I DID PERSONALLY 
Escpecially the Slideshow Carousel thingy, for that I used a tool called flickity
Also the card graphics were inspired by stuff I saw on CodeMyUi.com
I basically combined a few of those to get the effect I wanted
