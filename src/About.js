            <p>Hi! My name is Jeevi and I'm 18 years old. I am a freshman at the University of Maryland College Park. I'm currently planning on double majoring in Computer Science and Journalism. I like both of those things, so I have no idea how I'll pick one. Other things about me! I love reading and writing, and watching dumb rom-coms or childrens TV shows. I like trying to do things I see on pinterest, with varying levels of success. I like to write about stuff that's on my mind or stuff that's going on in the world, but mostly about stories. I also apparently deeply enjoy re-designing my website, since this is the fourth time I've done it. I like weird fashion and dungeons and dragons and podcasts(MBMBaM!). Oh! I like journaling! I have a lot of journals. I like journals. Also I have an incredible collection of pens that I am very proud of. I like coding, too. Did i mention that already?  </p>
